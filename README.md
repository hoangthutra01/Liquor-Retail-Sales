# Diageo America Sales
This data set includes all wholesale alcohol orders in the State of Iowa by retailers for sale to individuals as of January 1, 2012. This data set contains all alcohol orders wholesale from all grocery stores, liquor stores, convenience stores, etc., along with store and location details, exact wine brand and size, and number of bottles ordered.

In this report, I focus on the index analysis of one retailer, Diageo America, from 2021 to 2022.

I performed data cleaning. After that, I proceeded to classify customers into statuses such as new customers, lost customers, returning customers, and active customers and calculate the number of customers in each category.
